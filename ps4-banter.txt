thanked-champ: NO! THANK YOU!
thanked-champ: Flattery will get you everywhere %s!
thanked-champ: No problem %s. You are my favourite :)
thanked: Nee botha %s, ya flippin' big lad

follow-on: %s's %d (%c) is straight after - feel free to leave the PS4 on
follow-on: %s's %d (%c) is straight afterwards, so make sure to turn the PS4 off after you are done to show maximum disrespect
follow-on: %s's %d (%c) is straight after yours but don't let that stop you playing. If they want to play that bad, make them fight you for it
follow-on: Another game's scheduled straight after yours - %c's %d. It would be a shame if something were to happen to the PS4 before then
follow-on: %s is threatening to use the PS4 straight after you for %c's %d. Maybe try stacking some of those chairs in front of the kitchen door to prevent their entrance
follow-on: Be sure to hide the PS4 controllers, %s has %c's %d after yours but rumour has it they really wanted to play hide and seek
